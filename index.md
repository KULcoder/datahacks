## Shark Tank Deal Prediction

### Introduction

Shark Tank is a television show that allows prospective companies to pitch to wealthy investors. 
How could we **predict** whether a deal be made or not based on the description? 

Unlike other basic prediction project with multiple categorical/numerical features, a description only contains list of words.
To make a prediction based on descriptions, we have to utilize the concept of _natural language processing_: 
  extract different features from the text.
Human languages are complicated, not only notions (symbols) pointing to either abstract or concrete existance, but also tense, emotions, grammars, and other aspects we even can't understand.
Without the usage of Deep-Learning, there's a hope we can capture some meanings within those choice of features and how important they are with respect to our ultimate question: **_Is a company going to win wealthy investors' favor?_**

### Model Performance Analysis

For the model selection, we chose Support vector machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to make the binary prediction. To learn how each model performs on the dataset, we first split the dataset into training and testing set. To avoid overfitting and model bias, we adopt the strategy of cross validation and calculated the mean of the overall scores. For hyperparameter tuning, we use grid search to find the parameters that produces the most accurate result. We applied these strategies for all three classifiers, and found that the overall performance of them are decent with the average accuracy being slightly above 0.5. Compared to SVM and Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier gives a worse prediction performance. For our final prediction, we decided to use Logistic Regression Classifiers because it has a F1 score of 0.56. For future improvements, we would consider trying more models such as lightbgm, etc.
